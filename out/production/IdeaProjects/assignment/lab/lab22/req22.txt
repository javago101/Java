Create an interface named Measurable with methods named getArea and getType.
getType should return a String describing which type of shape it is.
Create Circle, Triangle, and Square classes, which each implement Measurable.
Each should contain the fields required to calculate the shape’s area.
 For example, circle should have a radius field.
Add a constructor to each which allows the client to set the fields.
getArea should calculate and return the shape’s area.
Hint: Use Math.PI when calculating the circle’s area.
In your Main.java, add a method that takes a reference to a Measurable object
 as an argument and prints its type and its area.
 In your main method, create one of each shape type and pass each to this method.
